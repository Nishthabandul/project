# Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Toolkit

Welcome to the **Anomaly Detection** repository! üéâ

Dive into a diverse array of machine learning techniques designed to identify anomalies in your data. From supervised to unsupervised learning methods, this repository offers a rich set of tools to tackle outliers and irregular patterns across various domains. Whether you're a data scientist, a machine learning enthusiast, or just someone intrigued by anomaly detection, you'll find something valuable here.

## üß© Overview

Anomaly detection, the task of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm, is vital in many applications like fraud detection, network security, and quality control. This repository provides implementations of various techniques using both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, allowing you to explore and compare different methods.

## üîç Techniques Covered

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the anomaly detection techniques you can explore:

### üè∑Ô∏è Supervised Learning

1. **Linear regression**:
   Anomaly detection in linear regression can be approached by identifying data points that significantly deviate from the predicted regression line. This can be done using statistical measures like residuals or by applying techniques such as the Z-score or Cook's distance.
   
2. **Polynomial Regression**:
  Anomaly detection in polynomial regression can be performed similarly to linear regression, with the main difference being that the model now fits a polynomial curve rather than a straight line. The anomalies are detected by identifying points with large residuals or using statistical measures like Z-scores.

3. **Decision Tree**-
Decision trees are not typically used directly for anomaly detection, but they can be applied by analysing the residuals of the model's predictions or by using Isolation Forests, which are a tree-based method specifically designed for anomaly detection.

4.** 3. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**-
Anomaly detection using the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm can be done by identifying points that have a large average distance to their nearest neighbours. These points are considered anomalies because they are far from other points in the dataset.

5.**Gaussian Na√Øve Bayesian**-
Anomaly detection using a Naive Bayes classifier isn't a typical approach because Naive Bayes is mainly used for classification tasks. However, we can adapt it for anomaly detection by modeling the likelihood of the data and flagging points that have a low probability as anomalies.
Example Code: Anomaly Detection Using Gaussian Naive Bayes
This approach involves calculating the probability of each data point under the Naive Bayes model and treating low-probability points as anomalies.



   

### üîç Unsupervised Learning

1.**K-means clustering**-
Anomaly detection using K-means clustering involves identifying points that are far from their respective cluster centroids. These points can be considered anomalies because they don't fit well into any of the clusters.


2.** FP GROWTH**-
Frequent Pattern (FP) Growth is an algorithm primarily used for mining frequent itemsets in a dataset, which is typically used in association rule mining. However, anomaly detection with FP-Growth isn't straightforward because FP-Growth isn't inherently designed for anomaly detection. Instead, you can adapt the concept by identifying transactions or data points that do not contain frequent patterns, treating them as anomalies.


3. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality and identify anomalies based on reconstruction error.
   - **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Visualize high-dimensional data and detect anomalies through clustering.

4. **HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL**-
Anomaly detection using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can be done by identifying sequences of observations that have low probabilities under the model. HMMs are typically used for modelling sequences of data, so this approach is particularly useful in time series anomaly detection.
