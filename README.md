# Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Toolkit

Welcome to the **Anomaly Detection** repository! 🎉

Dive into a diverse array of machine learning techniques designed to identify anomalies in your data. From supervised to unsupervised learning methods, this repository offers a rich set of tools to tackle outliers and irregular patterns across various domains. Whether you're a data scientist, a machine learning enthusiast, or just someone intrigued by anomaly detection, you'll find something valuable here.

## 🧩 Overview

Anomaly detection, the task of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm, is vital in many applications like fraud detection, network security, and quality control. This repository provides implementations of various techniques using both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, allowing you to explore and compare different methods.

## 🔍 Techniques Covered

Here’s a snapshot of the anomaly detection techniques you can explore:

### 🏷️ Supervised Learning

1. **Classification-Based Anomaly Detection**:
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Train a classifier to differentiate between normal and anomalous data.
   - **Random Forest Classifiers**: Use ensemble learning to classify data and detect anomalies.
   - **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Employ boosting techniques to improve anomaly detection performance.

2. **Regression-Based Methods**:
   - **Robust Regression**: Identify anomalies by analyzing deviations from regression models.
   - **Quantile Regression**: Detect outliers by modeling the conditional quantiles of the response variable.

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

1. **Distance-Based Methods**:
   - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Detect anomalies based on the distance to nearest neighbors.
   - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Cluster data and identify outliers as points not fitting into any cluster.

2. **Model-Based Methods**:
   - **Isolation Forest**: A tree-based model that isolates observations to detect anomalies.
   - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Measure the local density deviation of data points to identify outliers.
   - **One-Class SVM**: Find a decision boundary around normal data to detect anomalies.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality and identify anomalies based on reconstruction error.
   - **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Visualize high-dimensional data and detect anomalies through clustering.

4. **Deep Learning Approaches**:
   - **Autoencoders**: Neural networks trained to reconstruct input data, detecting anomalies based on reconstruction error.
   - **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**: An advanced autoencoder model that captures complex distributions for anomaly detection.
   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Use adversarial learning to detect anomalies by generating and comparing data.
